# The Tombow 8900 B

Another Japanese reasonable quality pencil. This one is grade 'B' - not my
normal choice, gut it is what turned up - I think I didn't realise I was ordering
a 'B' grade, and would normally have gone for an 'HB'.

## The company

[Tombow](https://www.tombow.com/en/company/index.html) are a Japanese pencil (well, stationary) company formed in 1913.
Tombow are prett well known in the pencil world, particularly for their Mono 100 - we'll get to review one of those at
some point, but not this week.

## The pencil itself
The 8900 is apparently Japans best selling pencil (according to the Tombow web site). It a nice straight forward
cedar pencil. Decent paint finish, no eraser (I'm not a huge fan of eraser capped pencils, I do prefer them without them).

I like the medium green paint. The pencil to me feels fairly light in the hand, but not too light - it still feels like a
quality pencil.

Let's fling up some other reviews:

## How does it write
Well, it is pretty smooth and has a nice dark line - but, that could be because this is a 'B' grade. It didn't wear noticly
much worse than an HB, but it was definitely no better. If anything, sure, it wears down a little faster than the Mitsubishi
9800.

## Sourcing

Again, maybe not something you are going to find in your local store, but they are sourceable via the internet. Mine came by import
by way of Amazon.
