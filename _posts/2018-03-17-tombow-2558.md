# Tombow 2558

## The company

[Tombow](http://www.tombow.com/en/index.html) are a Japanese stationary manufacturer formed in 1913.
All the Tombow pencils I've come across so far are quality products. afaik the only Tombow items I own are pencils.

## The pencil itself

The 2558 is sold as a high quality general purpose pencil [for students and office workers](http://www.tombow.com/en/catalog/writing/pencils/black_lead_pencils/2558.html). Despite having an almost classic American yellow pencil appearance, I don't think the intention here is to be a clone of such.

The 2558 is not the top of the line pencil from Tombow.

## How does it write

Having spent a week with this, and having probably written a little more with a pencil this week than I normally do, the pencil is just fine. OK, so I don't think *wow* when I pick it up to use, but nor do I not want to use it, and when actually using it, it writes pretty nicely.

Point retention seems fairly reasonable. I wrote a reasonable amount before I felt I needed to re-sharpen.

## Sourcing

Not a pencil you are just going to find here in a local shop - I sourced mine off Amazon during a cycle of 'I want to try some more Japanese Pencils'. A box of 12 is relativley cheap - so bang per buck on this is pretty good.
