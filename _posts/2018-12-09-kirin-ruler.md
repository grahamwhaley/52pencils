# Kirin ruler pencil

And now for something a little different. I don't have many novelty
pencils in my collection, but this interesting 'ruler pencil' is one
of them.

I don't remember exactly where I got this. My best guess is either I
got it in a Waterstones or in Paperchase. A search on the internet didn't
help me figure out which though.

## The company

All I can really find is that Kirin is a Japanese pencil manufactureres
who specialises in unique and novelty type pencils. I tried to track down
their website, but failed to find it. I found a hint they have one, and
you can find some of their pencils, including this ruler pencil, on
[pencils.jp](www.pencils.jp).

## The pencil itself

As the title suggests, this is a pencil that is marked up as a ruler.

As you can see, the pencil is also not hexagonal or round, but is
of rectangular cross section. The pencil also has an inches scale on
one side, and a centimeter scale on the other.

The finish on the pencil is pretty good - I actually quite like the
high gloss varnish finish, and the end cap is nicely rounded and painted.

One peculiarity about the shape of the pencil is that it does not
fit in my everyday pencil sharperner - it is just a tiny bit too
wide. Thus, once I'd worn it down a little, to resharpen it I had to
resort to some other manual single blade based sharperners - the result
was a somewhat blunt tip.

Sure, I think I could have dug out a long point sharpener that maybe
the pencil would have fitted in, but I didn't - and the stubby point
was good enough. I really should get around to doing a sharpener comparison
entry one day...

And finally, how do I know this is a Kirin brand pencil - well, there is
some very finely printed text on one of the narrow sides of the pencil
(that I did not spot immediately).

## How does it write

Given I viewed this as a novelty pencil, I was not expecting much. How
wrong could I have been. This pencil writes really really well. I really
enjoyed using it though the week. If I could find a dozen of these at a
decent price, or I could find any other Kirin brand pencils, then I would
go ahead and grab a box.

## Sourcing

As above, I don't remember where I got this, and a search shows up nothing
in the U.K., and only one place [in Japan](http://www.pencils.jp/product/51)
that is selling them.
If I could find them, I'd buy the. This is one pencil I will add to my
notional 'look out for' list in my head, and will pick up more if I see
them. Next time I am passing by Waterstones and Paperchase I will stick my
head in and see if that is where they were...
