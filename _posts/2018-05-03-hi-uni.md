# mitsu-bishi Hi-uni

A classic hi end pencil. This is one of the finer pencils in my collection, along with
things like the blackwings, tombo mono etc.

## The company

I really want to go point to a web site for 'mitsu-bishi' here, as that is what is wrtten on
the pencil - but, the website is listed as the [Uni company](https://www.mpuni.co.jp/products/pencils/#pencil).
This is all a touch odd, as [wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni-ball) Uni-ball is a subsiduary
of the mitsubishi pencil company. Heh.

I covered the Uni company back in my first post.

## The pencil itself

This is a classy pencil. Great finish. I love the colour, and they have a couple of unique finishing features,
such as the rounded end (which is not unique, but is rare),

and then the dinky little painted dimple in the end.

## How does it write

I like it. It writes great. To me this writes pretty closely to a Blackwing, but, it has a much longer
point retention. For me, I think this is probably my current favourite pencil.

## Sourcing

Off the internet, pretty easy. I strongly suspect during my next round of pencil purchases I may get
myself a dozen HBs...
