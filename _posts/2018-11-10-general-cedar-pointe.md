# General Cedar Pointe

There was a time, not too long ago but, well, maybe a few years, when I went
searching for naked (unvarnished) cedar wood pencils. This is one of the ones I found.

## The company

The [General Pencil Company](https://www.generalpencil.com/history.html) started in
America in 1889.

## The pencil itself

The pencils has a nice feel. I like the feel of the bare cedar, and I like the look. It is
topped with a black eraser that I did get a chance to try. It worked OK, but didn't feel like
the most effective eraser. Adequate though.

## How does it write

I quite liked it. Nice dark line, didn't wear down too fast, and not gritty. I was quite
happy using this through the week.

## Sourcing

It looks like these are reasonably available online. It looks like you can pick up a dozen
for Â£6-7, which is not a bad price for a reasonably nice pencil.
