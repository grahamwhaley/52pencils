# YPO generic office pencil

I don't know where this pencil came from. I think it may have been one of my 'finds' - and by that
I mean literally, found it, possibly in the street near where I live. There is a school not that far
from here, and I won't be surprised if this was dropped by a schoolchild.

## The company

As far as I can tell this is another generic pencil from the
[Yorkshire Purchasing Organisation](https://www.ypo.co.uk/), now known simply as 'YPO'. This is not
the first of these pencils I've acquired and used, and this one behaves similarly. See:

  - [OurPrice]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2019-02-24-ourprice %})

In summary, it is not a bad pencil. I've used it continuously at my desk for a couple of months and
it has never annoyed me or been replaced. Ultimately, possibly still one of the cheapest useable
pencils you will find - 144 pencils for Â£6.49 - 4.5pence per pencil!

## The pencil itself

The pencils is a pretty standard cheap pencil. It's not bad though - the paintwork is pretty smooth
and the wood pretty 'clean'. This is not a Japanese cedar pencil though - some vanilla white wood for
this one.

I've had no issues sharpening it, and no snapping lead etc. The write is reasonably smooth with a
little bit of grip (not a Blackwing..), and no anomolous grit!

## Sourcing

As noted, unless you happen to work or visit somewhere that has these as their standard pencil, or
you happen to find one in the street, then your only source is probably directly from YPO.
