# Our Price

I have a feeling this pencil will have come via some business stationry supply
company, and it will have come into my possesion by way of an office etc.

I'm thinking this will be a pretty cheap bulk purchase pencil.

## The company

I have literally no info. Well, that is what I thought, but the I realised
that the little sort of domino symbol just in front of the 'our' might actually
be a stylised 'y'... making this a 'your price'. That gave me a clue, and rang
a bell... and led me to the [YPO website](https://www.ypo.co.uk), where indeed
some of their products do use the phrase 'your price'. Tada!

That also rang a bell in my head, and indeed we have reviewed a different
pencil from the same company - the 'Your Finest' - over on the
[your finest]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-09-29-your-finest %}) page.

## The pencil itself

This is a rather red pencil. The wood is not cedar, and the paint finish
is not the best.

The stamp to me reads 'our price', but is actually I'm pretty sure 'your price'.

The only other mark on the pencil is what I suspect is a makers mark. Originally
I thought this said 'BQI', but upon close inspection, we can see it is 'BQL'.
I've not managed to identify any makers using that mark.

## How does it write

It writes OK. I had a fairly reasonable week using this, with no major complaints.

## Sourcing

I think the only way you are going to source these is directly from the
[YPO company](https://www.ypo.co.uk).
