# Palomino Blackwing 602

## The company

Let's be clear from the start - if you are reading a blog about pencils then the odds are you already may know more about the history
of the `blackwing` pencil than I do. There is no way I can, or probably should, try to cover the history here. Suffice to say that this
review is for a modern, current, Palomino Blackwing 602 - and not a classic (unobtainium???) blackwing.

The main website for the current blackwing is [blackwing602.com](https://blackwing602.com/about-us/)

See the references section for more links for more info.

## The pencil itself

The review is for the 602. I believe when generally folks refer to a Blackwing, this is the one they mean, but there
are currently three blackwing variants:
- Blackwing 602
- Blackwing Pearl
- Blackwing

each with different hardness - the 'blackwing' being the softest, and the 'blackwing 602' being the hardest.

As you can see in the picture, you can get all three as a 'set', which I have. One day in the future maybe I'll
review the other two blackwings.

Blackwings have a few interesting features. There is the iconic non-round eraser, which is adjustable. tbh, I don't use
a pencil eraser that much - 95% of my pencil use is writing and note scribbles, and if I get something wrong I tend to just
cross it out. Still, this is a nice eraser and a nice feature that it is adjustable and even replaceable.

What irks me a little though is that it is broader than the pencil body - this prevents me from using any blackwing stubs
in my [Derwent pencil externder](https://www.derwentart.com/en/gb/4452/2300124/pencil-extenders). This is not a cheap pencil,
it might be nice if I could squeeze every last bit out of them...

Anther thing that occurs to me is that this pencil feels longer than standard. Maybe that is the eraser extension - I'd really
have to go measure it to confirm.

## How does it write

Accordingly with its reputation, this is a pretty smooth pencil. It glides well, and produces a good dark line. I quite like it,
but I have been through a couple of these and I can note that they do wear down and need resharpening significantly more often than
most other pencils.

Do I like the Blackwing 602? Yes. Would I say this is my ultimate everyday pencil - well, hard to say yet - I have about another
50 various pencils to try yet before I try to make that sort of choice. Can I recommend you try one - yes, sure. They have a reputation
for a reason, and it is as good as any introduction to quality pencils, and they are moderately available.

## Sourcing

Generally I have sourced these off the internet, but I did acquire the mixed selection pack from a University art/book shop (though
it was not in the U.K.), so it may be worth seeking through local art shops and bookshop stationery departments as well.
may be worth searching 

## References

Oh, where to begin - maybe just a link to the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwing_602) as a hopping off point.
