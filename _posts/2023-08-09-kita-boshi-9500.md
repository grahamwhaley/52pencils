# Kita-Boshi 9500

## The company

The [Kita-Boshi Pencil Company](http://www.kitaboshi.co.jp/) (*Warning, that website looks to be in
Japanese only!) is a small family owned Pencil company in Japan. A funny thing happened to me here -
a friend of mine sent me a link to a nice
[YouTube video showing a Pencil production line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk_57TP6RFk)
that I find rather mesmorising - and it turns out to be of the Kita Boshi factory. I had a search of
this blog and realised I'd not done any reviews of them, but then to my surprise found I had a whole
box waiting in my stash!

Thus, after a rather long break from the blog, it was time to break out a new pencil!

## The pencil itself

Apparently I had a whole box of them...

These are well finished pencils. A nice very dark 'British Racing Green' type colour. No real ripples
or blemishes, and the embossing on both sides of the pencil is fairly crisp.

The pencil bodies are cedar, and so far I've had no issues with sharpening them. Well, apart from the
point is slightly off centre, when I sharpened my first one, but I think that is more a consequence of
my sharpener than the pencil. It's and odd thing - I have a feeling that once you have started to
sharpen a pencil off centre then it is quite hard to correct in later sharpenings. At least that is the
experience I have with my X-acto L. I wonder if it is something to do with the sharpening hole being
fractionally bigger than the pencil. It would not take much to make the off-centre point obvious (by
looking at the encircling cedar 'shoreline').

Looking at the end of the pencil though, the lead is nicely centred.

## How does it write

This is one smooth pencil. It writes very well. Well enough to have now been my on-desk everyday user
for the last 4 months. The feel is smooth, but not waxy. The line is very dark and crisp. The point
lasts a reasonable time. I can happily recommend these.

## Sourcing

These may not be the easiest pencils to source in the U.K. It looks like I got mine from
[Choosing Keeping](https://choosingkeeping.com/products/forest-green-kitaboshi-2b-writing-pencil)
err, nearly five years ago! They appear to have 2B at the moment, but I got a box of HB, for a very
reasonable price of £12.50 - that's only just over £1 each! A bargain.
