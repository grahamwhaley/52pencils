# Mitsubishi 9800 HB

First pencil?, will be a Mitsubishi 9800 HB.

Why? Well, no actual specific reason. I have quite a few pencils
I could have chosen from - some scrappy ones and some really nice
ones. So, why this one? It just happened to be one of the three or
so I have been cycling though on my desk, and one of the last batch
I picked up, which were some not so common (in the U.K.) Japanese
pencils.

## Mitsubishi

The [Mitsubishi Pencil Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni-ball), probably
now more generally known for the [Uni-Ball](http://www.uniball.com/home/index.html) brand,
are a Japanese company formed in 1887. These pencils are branded Mitsubishi, not Uni-Ball.

## The 9800 HB

This is a nice pencil. I like it. Good finish, cedar wood, good feel. I also happen to
like the British racing green paint finish, and the gold embossed print.

## How does it write

I quite like it. It has a nice dark line, and the point lasts a fair while. It is not the
smoothest (not like the waxy Blackwings for instance), and has a slight scratch, but relatively
speaking, this is a nice pencil to use. I find I come back to using it quite often.

## Sourcing

Although you are probably not going to find these in your local shops, they are relatively easy
to find via specialist suppliers or on the internet. I got mine via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=mitsubishi+9800)
