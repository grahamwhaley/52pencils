# Bismark HB

Well, it's been quite some time since I've posted an entry. Predominantly as I'd run down my pencil
collection to test, not been using them as much as I used to, and not been anywhere to naturally 'top
up' my swag.

These I think I found in a 'Chinese superstore' in Spain - you know, one of those places that does
everything you could think of. I'd read it was a fun place to stock up on things for you Camino trip
(no, we were not doing a Camino trip!), and thought I might find some unusual nick-nacks there.
This one is called ['Popular Oriental bazaar'](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sNtTFEZfA4AJQt7L9)
, and is located in Burgos.

## The company

On the back of the packaging it identifies the main producer as 'Poessa, S.A.'. Going to
[www.poessa.com](www.poessa.com)
brings up the site of a large manufacturing and distribution company. One of the things they do is
stationery, and Bismark is one of their brands. Sadly it looks like you need to be a distributor to
bring up their product pages.

On the back of the package it does however say the country of manufacture is China - so, no original
Spanish made pencil here...

## The pencil itself

On initial inspection the pencil looks just like a normal 'yellow' cheap pencil. Well, it is yellow,
and it is cheap! Picking the pencil up, the wood looks like some sort of cheap generic white wood, and
is definitely not cedar for instance. The paintwork is rather clean and neat. It does have a somewhat
plasticky feel to the paint though. A little like you find on those 'all plastic' pencils, but this
is definitely paint over wood. Its not unpleasant, or sticky or anything though.

The pencils come sharpened. It might not be so obvious in the photo, but the sharpening is slightly
concave. It's not a bad out of the box sharpening.

## How does it write

You know, I was expecting these to feel like some standard cheap pencil, a bit scratchy with the
occasional bit of grittiness. How wrong could I be. They are smooth, they are dark. There is no
scratchiness whatsoever. They are just slightly waxy in their feel. If you'd just handed me this and
asked me to guess where it was from I'd probably go for Japanese. These are actually pretty good
pencils, and I've been happily using one as my daily desk pencil for maybe 3 months now, with not a
single complaint. In fact, I quite look forward to picking the pencil up each day. And, it seems to
be wearing well as well, holding its point well.

Given the price I paid (0.90 Euros for 4 pencils, so 22.5 EuroCents each), these have got to be the
best bang-per-cent pencil I have ever acquired, hands down! If I'd known, I probalby would have taken
a whole handfull!!

## Sourcing

Well, I found mine in a cheap shop in Spain. It looks like they are distributed by a Spanish
manufacturer, so finding them in Spain is probalby easiest, but I do see them listed here and there
on Amazon, but didn't investigate if they are imports or not etc.
