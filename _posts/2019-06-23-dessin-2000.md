# title here

Here we have a [Faber Castell Dessin 2000 HB](http://www.faber-castell.eu/products/GraphitepencilDessin2000HB/112300).

## The company

Faber we have covered before, it being one of the more common pencil manufacturers here in the UK. Fabers website says they make over 2.3
billion wood cased pencils a year. Prolific I guess would be a fitting word.

## The pencil itself

The pencil has a reasonably finish, with a fairly complex paint job, with its black and red stiping with gold accents.

The tip came reasonalby sharp, and in fact iirc I used the pencil directly for a couple of days before sharpening it,
which is quite rare.

The tail is domed and painted:

and of course there is the obligatory barcode on the other side.

Apparently this Dessin is the pencil just below the Faber 9000 series in the quality stakes.

## How does it write

Although the pencil is marked as a 2 1/2 HB, to me it feels much more like an H grade. This is a pretty firm lead.
It writes fairly well, and wears fairly well. Despite the hardness I didn't find myself thinking the line was too
light.

Overall, not a bad pencil. I was fairly happy using this through the week.

## Sourcing

They seem available from specialist pen/pencil suppliers for under £1 each, or you can get a pack of 12 for around £8.
So, available, but maybe not in your local shop.
