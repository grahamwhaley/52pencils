# Staples Professional HB

Once on a 'pencil hunting drive', I raided the local Staples shop.
Along with the usual suspects, they had some 'own brand' pencils, and
some were in their 'professional' range. I grabbed a bunch, as they
were pretty cheap.

## The company

Staples is a UK chain of stationers, found on the high street and
with 'sheds' in the big shopping centers.

## The pencil itself

The pencil is an OK mixture of black and gold, with a tail tip.

But, the closer you look then you come to realise maybe this
pencil is not quite as 'Pro' as you might hope. If you take
a look at the embossing, then it is sadly somewhat third rate...

## How does it write

The pencil writes OK. I used it through the week, and it drew
a reasonably dark line, and didn't wear down too fast. I found
no grit in the lead. I was reasonably happy using the pencil.

## Sourcing

Being an 'own brand' pencil, I'm pretty sure you are only going to
source these from Staples themselves. Having said that, I just checked
their website to try and get some current pricing, and I don't see
them there. Maybe the line has been discontinued. These may no longer
be available.
