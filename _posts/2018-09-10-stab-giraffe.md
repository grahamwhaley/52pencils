# A Giraffe, or not?

Let's start by trying to figure something out. In my head ths is the 'giraffe' pencil,
but if you go look up what a giraffe looks like, it is brown with brown spots, not yellow
with black spots with white centers.... so, if this pencil were an animal, what sort of
animal would it be??

The closest I can come up with - is a Cheetah. Not quite the saem - afaict the Cheetah does
not have white centers to its spots - but, they are yellow, the spots can be black ish and
they do sem to have the right sort of shape... OK, I'm still going to call this the giraffe
pencil, but maybe it is really a Cheetah pencil.

## The company

We've covered [Schwan Stabilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwan-Stabilo) before. A good old
German manufacturer.

## The pencil itself

I have a liking for round pencils. I'm not quite sure why. Maybe it is just because they are
less common. Practically they are actually a little bit of a pain, trying to roll themselves
off my pad and desk. They do, generally, however fit into the 'perfecth pencil's.

The pencil seems to be made of a decent wood. I did notice one oddity on this pencil that
I'm not sure I've seen on any other. On the bottom end of the pencil, which is neither capped
or has an eraser, I cannot see the pencil lead in the center of the end though. All I see is solid
wood? I'm going to presume the lead does go nearly all the way through the pencil, and is not just
a stob in the front. We'll only find that out if I ever wear the pencil down I guess. You can see
that the pencil is made from two halves of wood though (clearly shown by a demarcation on the base).

## How does it write

It writes OK. A touch hard, but the line is dark enough, and not too scratchy. It is a reasonably
useable pencil.

## Sourcing

I think I picked this up on a bit of a whim in a high street stationery shop. I doubt it cost me
very much, but a quick surf does not turn up anything for purchase.
