# Berol Handwriting

What seems to be a fairly basic pencil on the face of it. Appears to be designed and sold
for school classroom use.

## The company

We have covered before. Sadly no longer an English manufacturer, and now owned by Sandford.

## The pencil itself

The pencils is a pretty distinctive red/white strip with a rounded red tip.

Unusually, the pencil came sharpened with a very acute angle, meaning it had
a very short tip:

After sharpening, that's a much nicer point, but, note how it is offset. Looks
like the lead is not quite central here.

I find the embossing on the pencil quite hard to read - but, yes, it really does
say 'handwriting' - here is a closeup:

## How does it write

I quite like this for writing. The line is nice and derk, and not scratchy. It's reasonably firm, but
does need sharpening reasonably often. I was quite happy using this through the week.

## Sourcing

I have a feeling I picked this up at some highstreet stationers. Having a look online, they look
quite easy to source - in fact you can buy a rather healthy quantity of 200 in a box for a tad
over Â£15 - that's what, 7.5pence per pencil - they don't get much cheaper than that really.
