# Calepino

There I was, looking for a pencil to review for the week, and having a bit of a surf
to see if there were some easily available that I did not have, when not only did I
find there was a pencil from 'Calepino' that I did not think I'd reviwed, but I
also found I already had a pack of them in my stash!

## The company

The [Calepino company](https://calepino.fr/en/) itself is really a maker of notebooks (the paper kind), but
they also do a [pencil](https://calepino.fr/en/product/black-wooden-pencil/) to go with them.

Calepino do not make the pencils themselves, but have them made by the only pencil manufacturer left in
France - [La Compagnie Francaise des Crayons](https://www.cfcrayons.fr).

## The pencil itself

The pencils are nice. They are a sort of eggshell black/grey finish, unsharpened, with a white eraser:

The text is pretty reserved and classy. Hey, no barcode!

They are made from Pulay wood. Not a wood I've heard of, or can easily locate - possibly that is the French
spelling for [Pulai](https://www.lesserknowntimberspecies.com/species/pulai).

## How does it write

The pencil, writes well. A good dark line. Slightly scratchy, but not too bad, and I like a bit of resistance
to my pencils. What did strike me was the wear resistance of the lead - very good. Did not have to sharpen the
pencil often at all.

## Sourcing

These are available from various internet supplies. They are not cheap - you are looking at £10 for 6 pencils, so
well over £1 each. But, they are quite nice, and reasonably unique.
