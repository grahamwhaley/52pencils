# Barcelo

A pencil I picked up from a Hotel. You know the sort (of pencil, not hotel),
the complementary pencils that come in hotel rooms with a very slim pad of paper...

This was from a Barcelo hotel chain hotel in Barcelona.

## The company

Well, the pencil alsmost undoutedly was not made by the hotel chain itself,
and there are no other details on the pencil to identify its origins. If I
had to guess then I'd say probably some generic pencil made in China or maybe
India?

## The pencil itself

The pencil is round. Always a challenge on my desk. For once I don't remember
this one rolling off and hitting the floor during the week though.

It is an OK silver finish, but it feels like that would wear or show signs of
dirt fairly quickly. The pencil has an eraser. I had a chance to use the eraser,
and it felt like one of those 'gritty' type ones.

## How does it write

It writes, surprisingly well. Better than I expected. The line is dark and the lead
was not gritty. Overall then, for a cheap pencil picked up in a hotel, not bad.

## Sourcing

Unless you happen to be staying in a Barcelo hotel, then I don't see another way
of getting one. But, hey. pick up other hotel pencils and try them out!
