# Caran technalo 779 water soluble HB

Some time ago we did a trip through Europe. We stopped in a number
of places, and as part of the trip I planned and tried to acquire
some European pencils that I would struggle to find locally.

The outcome was the acquisition of a number of pencils crossing
a range of manufacturers and qualities. Along with the pencils
I also picked up a wrap to bring them home safely:

One of the places I'd recommend you stop by, if you are a pencilophile
and in the area of Porto, Portugal, then I would say you should at least visit,
it not stay at, the [1829 Hotel](https://as1829.luxhotels.pt). The whole hotel used
to be a stationery shop. Now a hotel, they have kept a high class stationery shop
in reception, and they have some very nice wares. The pencil wrap came from there.

## The company

The pencil is from [Caran D'ache](https://store.carandache.com/uk/en/1503-graphite-pencils),
a Swiss pencil company founded in 1915. They are based in Geneva, and I've only ever seen them
making quality items.

## The pencil itself

Here we are looking at the technalo 779 HB water soluble pencil.

I didn't realise this was a water soluble pencil when I bought it, and didn't realise
until a short while after I started testing it. I didn't test the solubility at all,
and just used this as an every day normal pencil.

The point came reasonably sharpened (I do like the striations), but it was not until
I put a long point on the pencil until I realised the pencil has a thicker than normal
core - as is generally the way with artists pencils. Apparently these have a 3mm lead. I don't
have a reference to what a 'normal' pencil lead thickness is though.

The pencil itself is a nice sort of matt finish, and has a fairly nice gloss tail cap.

## How does it write

This pencil writes nicely. Quite smooth, quite dark. It wears at a medium rate - not too fast
but noticeable. I enjoyed using this pencil through the week.

## Sourcing

I picked mine up I think in an art shop in Paris. You can get these in the U.K. from specialist
pencil suppliers. I'm seeing the listed at something like Â£2.30 each. Definitely not a cheap
pencil.
