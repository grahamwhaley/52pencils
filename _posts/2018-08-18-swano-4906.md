# Stabilo Swano 4086

Another Stabilo (I didn't realise I had so many!). Another Swano! But, this time with a different number. Not that long ago we looked at the Stabilo Swano 307.

My gut feeling is that maybe the Swano 307 is an older model, and the 4906 is more modern.

## The company

We've covered this before - a long established German company. I did just note that they seem to have a healthy turnover and quite a few employees - I guess they are still doing OK.

## The pencil itself

The pencil itself is not too remarkable. Not bad, but not remarkable. This one is eraser topped. I did have occasion during the week to use it a couple of times - at first I thought maybe it had hardened up with age - I think it is just quite a firm eraser.

The wood seems quite nice - not sure it is cedar, but it does seem to be a bit more of a denser hardwood than some cheaper pencils.

## How does it write

For me, this is a nice pencil. I enjoyed using this. It is not too hard, and has just a slight bit of texture and resistance when writing. It leaves a good dark line. I really rather enjoyed using it thought the week.

## Sourcing

A quick internet search shows these are reasonably available, but not overly common. They are swinging in around 50p a piece. Given I think I have a box of these, and it is quite rare that I can or do buy a whole box unless it is via the internet, I suspect I got these from an internet order.
