# Berol Mirado

## The company

Phew, Berol has a [somewhat complex history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berol). Presently it is a brand name of Papermate - but I'm pretty sure this pencil is a pre-Papermate Mirado. I do have some Papermate pencils, and one day I'll get to reviwing those - but, not today.

## The pencil itself

The pencil feels a touch old. A little battered. I suspect I have had this around a little while. This is a classic 'yellow' pencil, with some simple embossing.

## How does it write

It, is rather nice. It is a dark line, I like the feel of the lead on the paper - smooth, but not too smooth (I like a little bit of resistance and feel from my pencils). This is nice. So nice, I tracked down a pack of 12 and ordered them.

## Sourcing

I found some, of these yellow Mirado's, on the internet. They were also rather cheap. OK, so the ones I ordered are eraser tipped, as that is all I could find. Yep, I like these enough that I sourced some more whilst I still could - I do suspec these are all old stock, and will get increasingly hard to find.
