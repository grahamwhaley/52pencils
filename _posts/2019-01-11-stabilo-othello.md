# title here

The Stabilo Othello is marketed as what seems to be an
[everyday run of the mill pencil](https://www.stabilo.com/uk/products/writing/graphite-pencils/stabilo-othello/).
Not bottom of the line, but not top of the range I suspect.

## The company

We've covered [Schwan-Stabilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwan-Stabilo) elsewhere - an old (1855) German
company.

## The pencil itself

The pencil is a fairly pleasing green with green stripes. Not too fancy, not too plain.

The finish is OK, but not in the league of Japanese high-end shiny smooth.

There is of course the obligatory bar code printed on the other side.

One nice feature is the tail cap - quite nicely done - smooth and shiny and the red
pops out quite nicely.

The pencil is made from some sort of hard-ish wood - not cedar, but not one of the
super lightweight woods you find on quite a few pencils presently.

One interesting feature is that upon sharpening, the wood has a very spicy aroma. It is very
reminiscent of the smell I get from the Caran d'Ache exotic wood pencils I have - that is a very
dense Beechwood pencil afaik, which does not have the same density feel as this pencil, but it does
have a very similar smell.

## How does it write

I quite like it. It writes dark, and had a good amount of 'feel', resistance when writing. I quite like
some resistance. It did wear down a little quick, and just once there was a bit of grit that came through the
lead, but overall I enjoyed using this through the week.

## Sourcing

They look moderately available. I see some for sale individually and as a set of 12 online. A set of
12 is about £11 - <£1 each is an OK price - much less than some premium pencils.

I don't remember where I got mine. I think I only have one, and suspect it came from a high street book
store pencil rack.
