# Anonymous 'S' logo triangular pencil

I'm running short of pencils from my stock to review! I had a dig through my unreviewed
stash, and came up with this. It is a reasonably classy looking triangular pencil with a
single character logo on it - but, I don't know where I got it, and I don't know whose
logo it is.

## The company

Well, that is the thing isn't it - I'm not sure. About the closest logo If you look at
the logo sideways then it very much looks like a stylised capital 'S'. The nearest I could
come up with from a surf was, it is very nearly the same as the Suzuki logo, but, not quite.

I have a strong-ish feeling maybe this was a pencil from a hotel chain. But, I can't find
any other clues or evidence.

## The pencil itself

The pencils is quite nice. A nice triangular shape, with a good and fairly heavy gloss
black finish:

The log is a single gold embossed item on the end. I think it is an 'S', which you can see
if you hold the pencil vertically.

The end cap is nicely rounded.

## How does it write

When I started off with the pencil it seemed somewhat variable. It was as if the lead
had some smooth parts and some scratchy parts. The more I used it though the smoother it
seemed to become.

As the week went on, using the pencil was OK. It didn't annoy me much, and I was quite
happy using it.

## Sourcing

Well, given I have no idea where it came from or who manufactured it, nope, I have no
idea where you might source one.
