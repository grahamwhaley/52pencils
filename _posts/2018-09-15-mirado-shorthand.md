# Mirado Shorthand by Berol

Here we have a classic yellow pencil. I suspect this is quite an old
pencil. I have no idea where I got it, but looking at the end of the pencil
there is a classic indiation that this was a 'find':

You can see that the end has been trimmed - this is a classic way
I'd trim off a broken or chewed end - I roll the end back and forth
under a penknife blade until it snaps off.

I don't chew pencils - yuk - so strongly suspect this pencil came to
me with a mangled end, and I trimmed it to a point where I would be
willing to actually use if.

## Berol

We've covered Berols complex history briefly before - needless to say,
the Berol who made this pencil are not the same Berol that exists today.

## The pencil itself

The pencil is slightly beat up, but not too bad. It has a few dents,
and as above the end has been a slightly mangled and chopped off. You can
also see a little stain on the embossing near the end.

## How does it write

Strangely enough, the pencil does not carry a hardness weighting on
the embossing. It feels quite hard. If I had to guess I'd say this pencil is
weighing in around an H grade. A little hard for my liking. And thus, it writes
OK, but a little hard and a little light.

## Sourcing

I suspect these are no longer available unless you scour the secondhand market.
