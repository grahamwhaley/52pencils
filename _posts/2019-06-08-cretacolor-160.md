# Cretacolor 160

Here we have a Cretacolor 160 fine art pencil. It was not until I went and looked up who and
what Cretacolor were, that I found this is of Austrian origin.

If I remember correctly, I picked this up whilst browsing around [Stuart R. Stevens](http://www.stuartstevenson.co.uk)
art and gilding shop in London - what an excellent artists supply shop, stuffed full of all sorts of materials and
implements. If you are passing that way, I'd recommend dropping in.

## The company

[Cretacolor](https://www.cretacolor.com/en/passion-en/history/) are an Austrian art company specialising
in fine art equipment. The company started in 1863.

## The pencil itself

The [160](https://www.cretacolor.com/en/products/cleos-fine-art-graphite-pencil/) is listed as a fine
art pencil. Normally I'd expect that to mean either a slightly chunkier pencil and almost always a slightly
thicker lead - but in this case, that seems not to be. This looks and feels like a fairly standard writing
pencil in its dimentions and build.

The finish on this pencil is really rather nice. A nice semi-matt body colour, a dual coloured
tail tip with a nice rounded finish. And, I really rather like the embossing - not just the
quality, but I rather like the fonts used as well.

## How does it write

Being an art pencil, I was not quite sure what to expect. Given the high end status of the pencil and the
quite professional finish, I thought it might perform well.

Normally I would expect that to mean a very smooth lead. In this case though the lead is not that smooth,
but a little more gritty. Funnily enough for me, that is a good thing. I like a little resistance to my
pencils, and a really smooth waxy lead is not wholly to my liking.

I liked using the pencil. I felt sharp and accurate, left a good line, did not feel like it was wearing down
to fast. I'd be happy using this as a day to day pencil.

## Sourcing

These obviously are available in the U.K., as that is how I sourced mine. I suspect you will only find them
at a few select artists supply stores though. You can of course purchase them online. It looks like you can get
packs of 3 HBs for £2-4, so maybe just under £1 each, which for an art graded pencil is not too bad.

One feature of the range, being an art range, is they are available all the way from 9H to 9B.

## Reviews

I didn't find too many reviews online. I saw there were a couple of youtube vlogs. I did find this blog review,
that also indicates there is some backstory history with the Koh-I-Noor pencils factories as well.
