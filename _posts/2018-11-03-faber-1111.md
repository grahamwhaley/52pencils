# Faber Catell 1111

A reasonably nice looking down to earth pencil.

## The company

We've covered Faber before. Their link to this pencil is
[here](https://www.faber-castell.com/products/Graphitepencil1111HB/111100)

## The pencil itself

The pencil itself is fairly stylish. It has a nice black finish, and some
pretty nice silver embossing.

It's not made from cedar, bug some lighter wood. It's OK, but it doesn't quite
have that nice denser cedar feel in the hand.

## How does it write

I like this pencil. The line is nice and dark, the writing is reasonably smooth
(not too gritty, and not too waxy). I'd be happy using this pencil on a daily
basis. Not a bad pencil.

## Sourcing

Seems pretty easy to source - it turns up on all the regular internet search
and purchase sites. And, it's pretty cheap too. You can score 10 of them for
around Â£4, so 40p a pencil, not terrible.
