# Stabilo Swano 307

Bac from a small break (more of that in another post... there are
pencils involved!), and due to timing, this pencil got more than its
fair share of use - more like 2 weeks worth than the alloted 1.

I'm not sure where I got this pencil from - no recollection at all.
Looking around, these are still available, but I suspect this has
been in my 'collection' for some time.

## The company

Stabilo, [Schwan Stabilo](https://www.stabilo.com/com/about-stabilo/company-facts/)
are a German manufacturing company, formed in 1855.

## The pencil itself

This is a pretty plain pencil. No fancy end cap, no particularly fancy paint job.
The quality of the embossing looks pretty reasonable, but it is a little hard to
tell from my sample as it is somewhat old and worn.

I don't think the wood is cedar. It sharpens just fine.

## How does it write

It actually writes better than I'd expected. Visually, I thought this was probably not
going to be in the top quality bracket, but the pencil actually performed pretty well.

OK, so maybe it does not have the silky smoothness of some pencils, and maybe just
once or twice a bit of scratchy grit made its way to the tip - but, overall, using
this for the best part of a couple of weeks, nothing really annoyed me, and I was
pretty happy with the lines this pencil layed down.

## Sourcing

I have no idea where I got my one from. I may have picked it up randomly as a stray
purchase, or I may have inherited it. You do fine Stabilo pencils of varying
model available here and there in the shops, and checking online I did see this model
for sale - but, looking at the current range of graphite pencils on the Stabilo site,
I suspect this model is no longer in production, and any for sale are end of line
products.
