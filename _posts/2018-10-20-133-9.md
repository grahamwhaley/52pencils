# Staedtler 133-9

## The company

We've covered this classic German pencil company elsewhere. They are a common pencil type here, so we get to review quite a few of them.

## The pencil itself

The pencil give the outward appearance of trying to have a little class. Trying a little too hard though maybe. It has silver embossed
shiny spots, and carries the somewhat 'mysterious' name of '133-9' - only it would seem.

The finish is quite a nice matt finish, and the silver embossing is done reasonably well. The pencil feels OK in the hand, fairly solid and with a touch of heft - not too much, but it does not feel too cheap.

## How does it write

Well, for me, not so nice. It is not scratchy or anything, but this is a pertty hard pencil, and writes a pretty light line. Fairly typical
for Staedtler, but I feel this one is even harder than normal. Not really my style. I didn't really enjoy using this through the week.

## Sourcing

If I remember right, I got a bunch of these off ebay. I don't remember what I was searching for at the time, so can't help with what
magic phrases might turn these up I'm afraid. I don't remember them being expensive. I think I got 8 or 12 delivered in a zip bag.
