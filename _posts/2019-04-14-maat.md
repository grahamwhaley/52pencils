# A pencil from the MAAT

This is a pencil I picked up in the shop at the Museum of Art,
Architecture and Technology [MAAT](https://www.maat.pt/en/about)
in Lisbon. We were on a trip through Europe, and I was collecting
pencils along the way. This fell into the checkout basket.

## The company

I've no idea who actually made the pencil. There are no maker marks
on the pencil. The Museum had a few interesting exhibits in it though.

## The pencil itself

The pencil on the face of it feels like the finish is maybe a little cheap.
It looks like it is meant to be white, but is almost like it is a little
bit 'dirty', like it is covered in dust. I've a feeling it doesn't travel
too well when maybe rubbing against its neighbours.

The pencil came with a very blunt tip:

But sharpened up pretty well.

At that point it was being quite nice to use, and then
after a little while.... the tip broke off:

and continued to break for some number of re-sharpens, even
to the point where I switched to a shorter point sharpener to see
if it was the lead.

After a while I got back to a useable point, but the pencil had shortened
somewhat. Maybe the pencil got dropped at some point, who knows. It's not
often I come across a pencil with broken lead in this day and age.

## How does it write

The pencil was surprisingley dark. I would say this was more like a B grade pencil than an HB.
It wrote nice and dark and fairly smooth. I didn't mind using the pencil, it made nice marks.

It's a shame the point broke on me a few times - hopefully it was just one sample that had had
a bad travel experience.

## Sourcing

I'm pretty sure the only way you can get these would be to travel to Portual, go to Lisbon,
and visit the [MAAT shop](https://www.maat.pt/en/shop).
