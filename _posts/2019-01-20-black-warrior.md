# Mirado Black Warrior

## The company

Ah, but which company. Without doing some research or grabbing my copy of
[The Pencil Perfect](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pencil-Perfect-Untold-Story-Cultural/) book, I will
try to remember my educated guess at the histor of the Mirado 'brand'.
IIRC, originally they were made by the Eagle pencil company, that then ended up belonging
to Berol, and is now part of Papermate.

The pencil we have here is a modern rendition - a Papermake Mirado Black Warrior.

## The pencil itself

A round pencil, a nice sort of satin black, and round! It includes an eraser on the
end.

The eraser is quite classy, with a red band of enamel around the middle.

Oddly, as I found on another pencil recently, the tip was amazingly acutely
sharpened to a blunt point - to the 'point' (pun intended) that I sharpened
it before even trying to use it.

As with maybe all round pencils, it did attempt to commit suicide by rolling off
the edge of my desk throughout the week - luckily I caught it in time, and it survived.

Reading some reviews, they note that the pencil is Cedar - but, tbh, I didn't notice
the characteristic smell when sharpening.

## How does it write

The pencil writes OK. Reasonably dark, and hard enough. But, overall, it left me feeling
a little underwhelmed. I think it had no major outstanding features - it was not amazingly
dark, nor smooth, nor long lasting. So, not a bad pencil, just middling in all ways I guess.

## Sourcing

Having a surf, it looks like these are only available in America. That probably makes
some sense - I have a feeling I picked these up on a trip Stateside.

## Reviews

There is a decent review and a lot of feedback over on [pencilrevolution](http://www.pencilrevolution.com/2006/05/review-of-papermate-mirado-black-warrior/)
