# title here

Another pencil from the time when I was seeking out naked cedar pencils. To be clear, that was probably at least five years ago.

If I remember, I think I picked this up in a sort of 'arts cafe', where is was one of the arty items for sale.

## The company

[Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/no-2-woodgrain-pencil-6-pack) are, unsurprisingly, more known for their
field note books than their pencils - but, along with a field notebook you do need something to write in them with.

I own a whole stack of notebooks, but funnily enough, I don't actually own any field notes ones.

I didn't find much info on the history of the company, but they are American, and I do suspect they are a relatively
recent forming (especially in the scheme of things with the world of pencils).

## The pencil itself

For a start, this is a round bodied pencil. I've stated before, I have some sort of soft spot for round bodied pencils, and
this one is no exception.

It is topped with a rather distinctive green eraser, and the body unvarnished cedar, which is something I quite like.

Nicely, and reasonably uniquely, on the 'back' of the pencil there is a paragraph of text explaining the materials
and eco ethics of the pencil, which is rather nice.

## How does it write

I quite like this pencil. Feels good in the hand and the line is dark enough and the lead not too smooth. It can be
a little bit scratchy at times, but overall I fairly enjoyed using it.

## Sourcing

Even in the U.K. these seem fairly available. About Â£5 for half a dozen.
