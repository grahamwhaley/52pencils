# Faber Castell 9000

## The company

I discuss Faber over in the [Perfect Pencil]({% post_url 2018-03-10-perfect-pencil %})
post - see there for some details.

## The pencil itself

I was expecting fairly good things from this pencil. It is sold in nice racks in art
shops and as a quality pencil here. The paint job is nice, and the gold embossing
oozes a touch of quality.

## How does it write

Coming to use the pencil after having recently used a number of Japanese pencils,
for an HB, this is a very hard lead. Not too scratchy, but definitely significantly
harder, and subsequently not as dark on the page, as the Japanese ones. I believe this
is a known trend or theme though - that Japanese pencils tend to be softer and darker
for their ratings than their Western counterparts. I guess maybe it is true.

Following on from that, point retention here is noticably much better. I found I
sharpened the pencil much less through the week. I did find though that the pencil did
not seem to lay down the same on different papers - it seemed quite sensitive to what I
think was the surface texture of the paper in use.

I'd quite like to try a B grade to see if that hits my happy place for softer and darker
pencils.

## Sourcing

Here this is relatively easy to source, being available (if you can find one) in many
art shops.
